    "Please design and implement a solution to crawl the publication title, year and author list of every unique publication record on the target website. Then, using Pandas DataFrame, please create and display a table that contains these unique records. The table should consist of five columns: the row number in the table, publication title, author list, year, and the number of authors (hint: you will need to develop an algorithm to work this out). The records in the table should be sorted first according to the descending number of author values, then by the descending number of year values, and finally by the titles from A to Z.

A for loop iterating topics encompassed this statement, wrapped in a a for loop iterating through the range of years required.\n",

I chose to display the proportions as fractions, as this ensured that the ratios were exact and so would not add up to more than 1. By using 'limit-denominator' the frcations were showed in their simplest form, allowing them to be interpretable.\n",

Outside this loop, but within the outer one for each publication, a for loop iterating through the list of topics holding one iterating through the publications on each topic page, would store a list of IF factors as items within the list outside all loops.
